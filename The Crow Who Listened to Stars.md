# The Crow Who Listened to Stars

In the deep night, a crow spread its wings and flew from star to star, listening.

## Joy

The crow flew to a golden star. "Oh, look!" the star sparkled. "I am covered in the most beautiful shimmering dust! It catches my light and makes everything around me glitter. Can you see how it dances? How it twirls? I am so excited by this tiny, wonderful thing!"

## Loneliness 

Next, the crow approached a silver star. "You've come," it whispered, its light trembling. "I hover here, so far from everything. Once, I had a cluster of stars around me, but they have all drifted away. Now I am here, alone, with nothing but my own quiet light." The crow stayed for a little. 

## Regret

The crow glided to a reddish star. "I did something terrible," the star murmured. "I was hungry, so I ate one of my own planets. Whole and complete, it disappeared into me. Now I can taste its memories, and I cannot forget what I have done." 

## Awe

The crow flew to small white star. "Look how vast everything is," it said softly. "So much what can't be seen or understood. I am so small, and the night is so big." The star fell silent, filled with deep stillness.

## Hope

Softly, the crow approached a pale blue star. "I keep shining," the star said quietly. "Even when darkness surrounds me, even when no one sees me. I do not promise anything will change. I simply continue."

The crow listened, dark eyes reflecting each star's story. And in the silence that followed, the crow burrows into thought: *What star lives inside me tonight?*
